    Filter OSM data into a KML file with custom POI 

The goal of this tool is to create a personal profile of travel preferences, then to scrape open GIS information 
for the location of interest and filter the POI (points of interest) for those matching your interests.

The output .kml file can be loaded into mapping solutions like MAPS.ME or Google My Maps so places of special
interest can be found easily while traveling.

The project is currently under development and is not yet functional.
